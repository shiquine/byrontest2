OUR BUSINESS:</em></strong></p><p><strong>This statement is made on behalf of Famously Proper Limited (“Byron”). Byron is a UK-based restaurant chain, serving “proper burgers”. Byron has 21 outlets with over 1000 employees in the UK. This statement is made pursuant to section 54 (1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Byron’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 25/06/17.</strong></p><p><strong><em>II. OUR COMMITMENT:</em></strong></p><p><strong>Byron is committed to ensuring that it conducts its business ethically and with integrity. Byron does not use slave labour anywhere in its own business, nor does Byron tolerate forced or compulsory labour or human trafficking. Byron is committed to ensuring that no such behaviour takes place in connection with the company. This commitment extends to Byron’s supply chain. Byron’s supplier relationships are based on lawful, efficient, and fair practices. We expect our suppliers to obey the laws that require them to treat workers fairly and provide a safe and healthy work environment. Byron will not knowingly use any supplier that uses forced, prison, or indentured labour. Byron will only work with suppliers who comply with all laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which the suppliers are doing business.</strong></p><p><strong><em>III. CONDUCTING BUSINESS:</em></strong></p><p><strong>Byron currently request that its suppliers comply with all applicable laws and adopt compliant working practices, including not utilising any form of compulsory labour or human trafficking. Byron’s suppliers are obliged to pass these requirements on to their own suppliers, and Byron expects all of its suppliers to police their own supply chains in order to root out modern slavery of any kind. Byron encourages anyone with information regarding modern slavery and human trafficking taking place at the Company or anywhere in its supply chain to make a report to the company’s People team/Supply Chain Department.</strong></p><p><strong><em>IV. FURTHER STEPS:</em></strong></p><p><strong>Byron to introduce a Supplier Code of Conduct, incorporating specific requirements regarding our MSA statement.</strong></p><p><strong>Investigate membership status with SEDEX, utilising their SMETA audit which is one of the most widely used social audit procedures in the world. It provides a globally-recognised way to assess responsible supply chain activities, including labour rights, health &amp; safety, the environment and business ethics.</strong></p><p><strong>Byron intend to implement the below process for FY17/18 (26/06/17 to 01/07/18) to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains:</strong></p><p><strong>Process:<br>• Consultative period to inform suppliers of our intent and collection of each supplier’s policy</strong></p><p><strong>• Carry out a high-level risk assessment with all direct suppliers and set a checklist for any new suppliers wishing to work with Byron</strong></p><p><strong>• Identify products and suppliers where risk is possible</strong></p><p><strong>• For any current supplier where there is no policy, to liaise with the supplier to understand their future intentions and what actions they have in place. Alternatively, to re-source products from suppliers who are committed to combatting slavery</strong></p><p><strong>• Mitigate risk by sourcing in countries outside the published risk areas • Monitor suppliers on a continual basis</strong></p><p><strong>People:<br>• Each department is responsible for the suppliers they manage</strong></p><p><strong>• Supply Chain, People, I.T., Marketing, Property, Operations<br>• Supply Chain to own the review of suppliers’ policies and update annually</strong></p><p><strong>Implementation:<br>• Supply Chain to consult with each relevant department (stated above) who manage a supply base</strong></p><p><strong>• Supply Chain to collate supplier policies and implement the above process • Byron to hold copies of all supplier statements and review annually</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Key Dates:<br>• Start process beginning of FY17/18 (26/06/17)</strong></p><p><strong>• Target to have all supplier policies and an understanding of our current supply chain by the end of FY17/18 (01/07/18)</strong></p><p><strong>• Continual assessment throughout 2018/19 for review at the end 2018/19</strong></p><p><strong>4. Byron intend to measure how effective our policy has been to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains by continual assessment and reviewing suppliers’ policies annually.</strong></p><p><strong>TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS OF WEBSITE USE<br>Welcome to our website, www.byronburgers.co,uk, which is accessible via your computer or your portable hand-held device (the “Website”).
