This product is made without gluten, but there may be a risk of cross contamination.</p><p>(*) Whilst these products do not contain the listed allergen, our lovely suppliers have asked us to warn you that one of the component ingredients is made in an environment where this allergen is present. Therefore, cross-contamination, whilst unlikely, is possible.</p><p>We do not declare every ingredient used within a dish on this menu, and recipes may be subject to change. We will do our very best to accommodate you, and whilst every effort is made to minimise cross-contamination, our ingredients are manufactured, and our dishes are prepared, in environments where allergens are present. We cannot therefore guarantee that any item on our menu is 100% allergen-free. If you have further questions, you must speak to the Manager.</p>
