We welcome Gender Pay Gap reporting as an important opportunity to continue to promote transparency and equality of opportunity for women in work. We have a mean gender pay gap of 3.1% favouring males, and a median gender pay gap of 4.7%. This is a narrower gap when compared to the median figures with the Office of National statistics figure (17.9% for all employees inclusive of part-time workers).</strong></p><p><strong>We are confident that men and women performing the same roles are paid equally across our organisation because we use salary bands to enable us to manage fair pay.</strong></p><p><strong>Pay and bonus gap data and analysis<br>Mean gap % Median gap % Hourly pay 3.1 4.7 Bonus pay -113.09 -527.73</strong></p><p><strong>Proportions receiving bonus %</strong></p><p><strong>Male 48.8</strong></p><p><strong>Female 66.42</strong></p><p><strong>Our back-of-house (“BOH”) teams (chefs and kitchen staff) are male dominated and these jobs have a higher hourly rate, compared to the jobs in our front-of house teams (“FOH”). Most of our female population work FOH or within our Central team. This distribution of men and women across our workforce affects our pay and bonus gap.</strong></p><p><strong>Our mean pay gap has improved from 11% in 2017 to 3.1% in 2018. In general, this is because we now broadly employ equal levels of males and females in our FOH and central teams. However, in 2018 a higher number of females moved into senior roles in the Central team.</strong></p><p><strong>The median has marginally increased from 4% in 2017 to 4.7% in 2018.</strong></p><p><strong>Our mean bonus gap currently stands at -113.09% favouring females; with our median bonus gap also favouring females at -527.73%. This is broadly consistent with 2017 data analysis. The bonus data is distorted due to a high proportion of our chefs, who are mainly males receiving only nominal quarterly bonuses resulting in more men qualifying for bonuses at a lower value.</strong></p><p><strong>A significant proportion of female employees receiving a bonus are in management roles and therefore receive a higher bonus.</strong></p><p><strong>Quartiles: proportion of different genders Quartiles Band % Male % Female Lower 56.2 43.8 Lower Middle 62.0 38.0 Upper Middle 70.2 29.8 Upper 64.8 35.2</strong></p><p><strong>We have seen an increase in the percentage of females employed at the lower middle and upper quartiles. This has been positively impacted by upper middle female managers being promoted to the upper quartile, including the Central team, as noted above.</strong></p><p><strong>Conclusion: Whilst we have made progress in closing the gender pay gap overall, our business is in a transformation programme and we are aware that there has been a fall in senior females in the business which will affect our 2019 report.</strong></p><p><strong>We will continue to encourage the development and recruitment of females in senior positions within our business and for them to pursue careers in the BOH environment. In demonstration of this we have recently recruited a female Food Director and have promoted a female Head Chef to BOH Training Manager to oversee BOH development and innovation.</strong></p><p></p>"
